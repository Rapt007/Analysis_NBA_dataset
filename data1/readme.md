## This project is regarding the analysis over NBA data set which involves cleaning of the data and checking the correlation between the attributes of the dataset so that I can get to know whether to run PCA or not

#### This is the image of the heatmap you can see
![alter](heatmap_corr.png)
I will be running PCA but not here.
I will be displaying the results with PCA in different program


------
#### Then started with normalizing the data and then running Linear Regression over it

Then finally predicting the results
![pred](pred.png)

This is the prediction of the instances of test data

![pred2](pred2.png)

This is the scatter plot displaying the Y_pred vs Y_act

Finally measuring the R2 value which is .92 which is good only to determine the goodness of fit.
